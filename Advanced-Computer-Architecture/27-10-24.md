# Computer Architecture Notes

---

## Session 1 - 06.10.24

- **ADC/DAC**: Analog-to-Digital Converter / Digital-to-Analog Converter
- **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**
- **CODEC**: Coder-Decoder / Encoder-Decoder
- **DFA, NFA, Turing Machine** (Automata)

- \( f(x) = \frac{\pi}{x^3} \)
  - Breaks at \( x = 3 \).
  - Discrete function.

- **Herbert's Conformance**: 27 Problems.

### Polynomial Roots Problem
- For a polynomial \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + K = 0 \)
  - Question: Are roots integer?
  - Methods:
    1. **Brute Force** → **Dove Tail**
       - This method is not classified as an algorithm.
    - **No Solution Exists**: Proven by Turing using Turing Machine.

## Session 2

- **Von Neumann Architecture** → General Purpose Machine
  - Program = Combination of operands and operations.
  - Shared memory for program and data.

### Flynn’s Classification

|       | Data Stream        |
|-------|---------------------|
|       | Single     | Multiple  |
| Single| **SISD**   | **SIMD**  |
| Multiple | **MISD** | **MIMD**  |

- **SISD**: Single Instruction, Single Data
- **SIMD**: Single Instruction, Multiple Data
- **MISD**: Multiple Instructions, Single Data
  - Not widely used.
  - Simultaneous execution of multiple instructions on a single data stream.
- **MIMD**: Multiple Instructions, Multiple Data

- **Von Neumann Machine** is typically classified as **SISD**.
- Example: **ILLIAC IV** (SIMD architecture)

### Additional Notes
- **Pipelining**: Commonly used in SIMD and MIMD but not widely in MISD.
- **Vector Processors**: Used in SIMD for parallel data processing.
  - **Break Tactic**: 4 architectures each for SIMD and MIMD.
  - **Applications**: Various applications in vector processing.
